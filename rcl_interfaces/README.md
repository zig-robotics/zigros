# Zig package for rcl_interfaces

Currently this only builds the interfaces mandatory for building rcl and rclcpp:
 - builtin_interfaces
 - service_msgs 
 - type_description_interfaces 
 - rcl_interfaces
 - rosgraph_msgs
 - statistics_msgs

Still missing:
 - action_msgs
 - composition_interfaces
 - lifecycle_msgs
 - test_msgs
