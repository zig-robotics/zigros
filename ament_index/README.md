# Zig package for ament_index

This provides a zig package for the ros2 ament_index project.
This currently targets zig 0.15 and ROS Jazzy.

Note, this package is only built to satisfy rclcpps linking requirements.
It is not actually functional as the zig build is *not* ament, and does not try to play nice with it.
